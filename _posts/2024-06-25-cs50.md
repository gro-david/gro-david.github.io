description: "Doing the Harvard CS50 course..."

Since the summer holiday is starting in Germany I have decided to do start doing the Harvard CS50 course. I have heard a lot of good things about it and I am excited to learn more about computer science. I will be posting updates on my progress here. If you are interested in the course, you can find it [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/).

There are also a lot of related courses. Some of them I will be doing myself, for example the Python, Web Development, Game Development and AI courses.
