The GameDev-AG the school club I founded last year got together for the second year. This time around we were 7 highschoolers from grades 8 to 11. We learned the basics of game development independently with the help of the documentation and with the help of other working group members. We not only learned programming in the Python-like programming language GDScript, but also created our own sprites and characters. We also dealt with the basic principles of UI/UX and the basics of game design. We worked with industry standard software such as Visual Studio Code for writing code, Git and GitHub for version control and effective collaboration. To develop the games, we used the Godot game engine, which is not only efficient, but also has extensive documentation and publicly accessible source code.

As the highlight of the whole club worked together to plan and develop a brand new top down rouge-like shooter game, where you play as a cowboy beaver stranded in space trying to survive among the debris and the robots who - after the downfall of humanity - turned evil. Some took care of the sprites, some of the menus while others worked on the programming of the core mechanics. In the process, we learned the basics of project planning, project management and time management. Our game was successfully completed, published and presented at Gauss-Rockt according to plan.
