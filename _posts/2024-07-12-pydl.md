description: "A very advanced YouTube downloader in the terminal..."

This is one of the more advanced YouTube Downloaders out there. It is written in Python and utilises a few libraries to achieve its functionality. It uses ```pytube``` to download the songs, ```ytmusicapi``` to fetch some metadata and optionally upload the downloaded songs as your own library. This allows premium functionality for the uploaded songs. Using ```rich click```, we can create beautiful yet functional CLI interfaces. The project also utilises a patched version of the ```click-shell``` library to allow for a shell interface. Rich functionality needed to be added to the library to make it more consistent with the default CLI. PyDl of course allows you to download songs and playlists, but also the top songs of any artist or channel, which no other downloader has support for.
