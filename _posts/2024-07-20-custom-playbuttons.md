A while back this year I created an extension for the Godot Game Engine that allows you to create play buttons to play specific pre-selected scenes, instead of the one currently being edited or the one configured as the main scene of the project. Before starting I suggested the same on the Godot Engine Proposals GitHub repo, and with the support of contributors I created this small project.

This allowed me insights into the world of extension development for the Godot Engine.
