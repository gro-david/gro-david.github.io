This was not my first time participating in this Jam. I have always liked the idea of game jams, but every time I tried participating I participated in a suboptimal team, where we did not end up submitting anything in the end.

This time around I decided that I would not join a team, but participate on my own. Both to see how well I would manage and to avoid another bad experience. But then some wonderful people messaged me on the Brackeys Discord server and invited me to their team. At first I was hesitant to join but in the end I am glad I did join them. The team was mostly from central Europe but there were a few members from the Americas too. For the first few hours of the jam we just brainstormed ideas for this year's them: 'The Calm before the Storm'. In the end we went for a turn based rouge-like game, where on each level you had a few turns to explore, but then the game master would get angry and send a frenzy of enemies after you. We had a pretty complete game, with wonderful visuals, some great music and very enjoyable levels.

I was mostly busy implementing the background logic, and engineered the systems which powered the game. All in all we had a great time, and will continue to collaborate at hopefully lots of jams.
