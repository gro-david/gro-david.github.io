# Happy new year everyone!

This year - after lots of unfinished, large and bulky projects - I decided that it was time to create something that I could publish. My solution for this was to create lots of smaller projects, one every week, with this strict time limit I could experiment with a lot of differenet styles and learn a lot of different things. I goal for this is for each project to be as different from the other ones as possible and to do everything that I possibly can myself. I will have to create the, artwork and for some projects eventually also some music or soundtracks. With that I would also learn a little bit of time management, and also have time for everything else that I want or have to do, since I am limiting myself to more or less 45 minutes daily. 

For this week I started with an idea by ChatGPT which was to create a game in which gravity was not constant but could instead be flipped. For this I was inspired by a game named Mind over Magnet, and decided to go for a magnet dude and a permanent magnetic field, the polarity of which could be switched around by pressing the Shift key. Otherwise the game is a standard plattformer. My greatest difficulty was creating all the artwork and animations, which took a lot more time than planned. This meant that the today I worked for a lot longer than just 45 minutes. But in the end I am quite happy with how the game turned out. Even though I only had time to create one level (beside the tutorial), the game is quite polished, and with a few more levels absolutely publishable. 

## Interested?
The game will be published as soon as I find the time to create a few more levels, on my [itch.io](https://gro-david.itch.io) page.
