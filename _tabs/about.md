Hello ðŸ‘‹,

my name is DÃ¡vid. I am 17 years old and am visiting the Carl Friedrich GauÃŸ Gymnasium in Hockenheim Germany. I am in the 11th grade (out of 12). I am very much interested in Game Development, Programming and Computer Science in general. I also have a burning passion for FOSS and am a hardcore Linux fan. (I am using Arch, btw). My hobbies are Rubik's Cubing, playing the guitar, reading and of course coding.

I was born in 2006 in Hungary, but then moved to Germany, where I am also currently living. In my free time (of which I unfortunately don't have too much) I love some heated discussions about ethics, politics and sociology with my friends, or playing some board games.

I of course also love listening to music, and am a listener of many genres including Metal, Hard Rock but also Pop and Classical music. If you are interested in what music I listen to, take a look at this article of my blog: (Blog coming soon...)

One of my other favorite activities is freestyle urban inline rollerskating. Which is basically just doing tricks in an urban environment (and not in skate parks) over as many different obstacles as possible. This includes skating stairs, drops and jumps, but also skating backwards or doing slalom tricks.
